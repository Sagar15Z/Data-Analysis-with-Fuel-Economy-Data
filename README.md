This project focuses on analyzing vehicle fuel economy data from 2008 and 2018, sourced from the U.S. EPA. The goal is to clean and compare datasets across the two years to discover trends.

ðŸ§ª Process Steps:

Data Gathering:

Imported two datasets: all_alpha_08.csv and all_alpha_18.csv.

Initial Investigation:

Explored dataset shapes and structures.

Reviewed documentation to understand variables (e.g., Stnd, Cyl, Trans, Drv).

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing or inconsistent data.

Corrected data types and removed duplicates.

Aligned 2008 and 2018 data formats for comparison.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Compared fuel economy improvements.

Investigated vehicle type distribution and engine changes.

Asked questions like:

How has the average MPG changed?

Which manufacturers improved efficiency the most?

Findings:

Noted overall improvement in fuel economy between 2008 and 2018.

Observed shifts in vehicle types and manufacturer focus on fuel-efficient designs.

âœ… Outcome:
Insights into fuel economy trends over a decade, useful for environmental impact studies or automotive market analysis.
